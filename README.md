# NLP-Basics
This is a tutorial that covers the basics of NLP. We will cover few rudimentary operations such as tokenization, stemming etc.

Here are the tasks we will be performing in the notebook.

Given the text file (grail.txt) from the Web Text Corpus of NLTK, perform the following tasks:

1. Report the number of sentences and tokens contained in the file given as input.
2. Convert the whole text to lower case and report the number of unique tokens present before and after lower casing in the input file.
3. Report the number of stopwords in the file. Report the number of tokens left after stopword removal.
4. Perform stemming after removing stopwords and report the number of unique tokens left in the text.
5. Report the number of words starting with a consonant and the number of words starting with a vowel in the file given after performing steps 1,2,3, and 4.
6. Given a word and a file as input, return the number of sentences starting with that word in the input file after performing steps 1,2,3, and 4.
7. Given a word and a file as input, return the number of sentences ending with that word in the input file after performing steps 1,2,3, and 4.
8. Given a word and a file as input, return the count of that word in the input file after performing steps 1,2,3, and 4.
